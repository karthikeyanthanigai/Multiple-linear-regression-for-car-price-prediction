# Red-Wine-Quality-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
In this repository we will see what is this red wine quality problem parameters/variable values and try to fit this values in a ***Multiple linear regression*** .

To run the code follow the below steps:

1.Install python(3.6+) and need packages.
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip instll pandas
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```
pip install seaborn
```

2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/Red-Wine-Quality-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression.git
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd Red-Wine-Quality-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python multi.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
And In this problem we got a decent result. but this result can be better in other machine learning models. So check all my other repositories to find a better model for this problem.
