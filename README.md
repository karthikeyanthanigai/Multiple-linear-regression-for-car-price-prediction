```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```
pip install seaborn
```

2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/Multiple-linear-regression-for-car-price-prediction.git
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd Multiple-linear-regression-for-car-price-prediction
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python multi.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
The Prediction rate can be increased in other Regression models with Boosting and other methods/Algorithms.
